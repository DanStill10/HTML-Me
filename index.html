            <p>Throughout my life I was pretty much thrown into sports i didn't quite enjoy(Football, Soccer, Hockey, Baseball).My opinion 
                on Track and Feild was no exception.That is until i figured out that there were events that consisted of things that were not 
                <q>Run, run, run, run!!</q>

            <p>When I was introduced to track and feild I was not intruiged, assuming that it would be just another sport that I wouldnt like;
                with parents that are too competitive about their kids. While the ladder was true,the field events are where I shined.As funny
                as it is, I found my talent by being quite lazy, opting for something that I thought (much emphasis on thought) required less
                work and practice. Little did I know that before I knew it, I would be winning state tournaments and even placing nationally.

            <p>As my athletic career continued, i began to recieve looks from colleges and personal olympic trainers and much more. I was almost
                certain that I would be on a road of fun and success doing discus, shotput, and hammerthrow. But my dreams of easy going were set back
                during the spring of my freshman year. I had to have surgery on my left foot, removal of a bone spur on the top of my foot. I had to
                have the surgery in order to continue walking and moving properly. Consiquintly my season was cut short, not to mention that while
                The surgery did keep me from limping whenever I walked; my throwing form was never quite the same.

        <p>Although I was never able to return to being the thrower that I was pre surgery, along with contact from colleges and coaches became
            far and few between. I decided to continue to be as best as I could possibly be for as long as I could. My senior year of highschool
            I proved usefull to my team as we became the first Cardinal Ritter Boys Track Team to win the state championship by a single point.
            Our last event is what got us the last point, earned by none other than yours truly Daniel Still.
